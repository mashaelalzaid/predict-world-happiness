This year's report is the sixth since 2012, as governments, international organizations and civil society try to increase the use of indicators of happiness to illustrate their works plans and decision-making mechanism, especially political ones. Knowledge Discover in Database was followed to implement different algorithms using R language to predict World Happiness Score. 4 algorithms were used, 3 of them were Ensembled. The results showed that Stochastic Gradient Boosting performed the best among the other algorithms with accuracy 0.8. The researchers found that Social.support was the most important factor that affects world happiness and hence researchers suggest that governments should pay attention to Social Support to enhance their societies satisfaction, the researchers also suggest further researches should be conducted to predict happiness score based on countries.
